A CMS built on the MEAN stack. Mongodb, Express, Angular, Node. Uses CKEdit for inline editing and bootstrap for backend. Currently under development in early stages. Does not have any user authentication.

Makes sure to run "npm install" in your terminal or "sudo npm install" if needed. 

MongoDB must also be running in the background. If mongodb is installed on your machine open a new terminal window and type, "mongod".
